Hello team, I hope everyone is doing well.
You are so stupid and incompetent at your job.
This project looks really promising, great work!
I hate this idea, it's completely terrible.
Thanks for the collaboration, looking forward to our next meeting.
Shut up and stop bothering me with this nonsense.
Your presentation was very informative and well-structured.
